# Off Topic

* __Do not post minecraft-related content__
    
    We have a whole forum dedicated to Minecraft-related content already. 
    The Off-Topic section is only for posting content that has nothing to do with Minecraft.

* __Do not sell items of any kind__

    The forum is not a marketplace.
    
* __Do not create video related threads__

    If you would like to share and discuss a video, use the official chat thread.
    
* __Do not disrupt roleplays / forum games__

    Participating in a roleplay requires following of that roleplay's rules.
    Disrupting a roleplay (or forum game) is not allowed.
    
* __No OS / browser / console wars__

    Operating system vs. operating system and/or console vs. console, browser 
    vs. browser threads always descend into spam, flaming and flamebaiting and are therefore not allowed.

*__ No video-related threads__
    
    If you wish to post and dicuss a video, you can do so in the Chat Thread,
    which you can find in the General off-topic section.
