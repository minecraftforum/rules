## Suggestions

* __No Duplicate Suggestions__

    Unless a suggestion hasn't had any discussion in over a month, do not post a duplicate of that suggestion. Variations of an existing suggestion are fine, as long as the suggestion covers different ground than the original (i.e two dragon mob suggestion threads can exist as long as there is variation between them). Do not make duplicates of commonly suggested items; including, but not limited to, Obsidian Armor/Tools, Emerald Armor/Tools, etc.

* __No Vague Suggestions__

    Suggestions that are vague or unclear will be removed. For proper discussion
    to happen suggestions must be well explained and, if necessary, well
    demonstrated. However, this does not mean suggestions need to be fully fleshed out before posting. As long as a meaningful discussion can take place, a suggestion will not be considered vague.

* __Existing Mod(s)__

    If a mod exists that provides part (or all) of the suggestions request linking
    to the mod is encouraged, however do not use the existence of a mod to
    dismiss the suggestion. Suggestions are primarily for vanilla Minecraft
    features.

* __No Wishlists__

    Do not post more than one suggestion per topic. Very closely related suggestions are fine
    but separate suggestions require separate topics. "Wishlists" will be closed or deleted.
