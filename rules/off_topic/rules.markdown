* __Do not disrupt roleplays / forum games__

    Participating in a roleplay requires following of that roleplay's rules.
    Disrupting a roleplay (or forum game) is not allowed.
    
* __No OS / browser / console wars__

    Operating system vs. operating system and/or console vs. console, browser 
    vs. browser topics always descend into spam, flaming and flamebaiting and are 
    therefore not allowed.
