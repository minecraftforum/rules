* __Do Not Disrupt Roleplays / Forum Games__

    Participating in a roleplay requires following of that roleplay's rules. Disrupting a roleplay (or forum game) is not allowed.

* __No OS/Browser/Console Wars__

    Operating system vs. operating system and/or console vs. console, browser 
    vs. browser topics always descend into spam, flaming and flame baiting and are 
    therefore not allowed.
