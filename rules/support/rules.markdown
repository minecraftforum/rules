# Minecraft Support

* __Threads can be "Bumped" every 12 hours if no one responds__

    This is allowed in this section because users actually need a response in this section.

* __Do not request support for cracked servers and/or cracked clients__

    We do not support the use of cracked clients or cracked servers, and therefore will not allow people to request technical support for a cracked client/server.

* __Do not participate in OS/Platform/Browser wars__

    No one operating system, Platform, or browser was meant to run minecraft, and making topics or posts supporting a single os/Platform/browser will just degrade into flaming and trolling.
    
* __Do not Redistribute property of Mojang__

    Do not distribute any property of Mojang to other members on the forum. This includes: the minecraft launcher, the minecraft Jar, and the Minecraft server client.

* __Do not give out or request personal information__

    Personal information includes: Your location, your birthday, your transaction id, and credit card details. This information can be used to steal your Minecraft/Mojang account, and should not be given out under any circumstances.

* __Do not request help on Topics that do not relate to your issue__

    If you cannot find a topic that relates to your issue, then make a new topic about your issue. Posting on random support threads will just make it harder for other people to get support.
    
* __Do not post forum support questions in this section__

    Forum support questions belong in the Forum Discussion & Information section


## Minecraft Game Client Support

This section is for requesting support with an unmodifed client.

* __Do not ask for help with redstone__

    Redstone questions should be asked in the Redstone section of Minecraft General.
    

## Modded Client Support

This section is for requesting support with a modified client.

* Do not distribute modified Minecraft Jars

## Server Support

This section is for requesting support with the server client. Anything non-bukkit server technical support questions should go here.

* Do not advertise your server in this section
* __Do not make blacklist threads__

    Do not post threads that tell people to ban a certain user from their servers. 
    
* __Do not ask for Bukkit support__

    Bukkit questions should be asked on the [Bukkit Forum](http://forums.bukkit.org/forums/bukkit-help.6/).
    
### Server Administration

* Bumping once every 48 hours on support-related topics is allowed
    * This is only this section, and only if there are no replies from other people after that time
* Posting "there is a plugin/mod for that" without linking in the post is not allowed
* Necroing (posting on an old topic) is not encouraged
* Read the pinned topics before posting to avoid unneeded spam for questions that are addressed in those topics



## Mojang Accounts / Minecraft.net Support

This section is for questions about Mojang's websites, such as minecraft.net, or your Mojang account. 

* __Check [help.mojang.com](http://help.mojang.com) before making a thread__

    Mojang's help website, help.mojang.com, contains useful information that can help you resolve your issue. You can check Mojang's server status, and find solutions to common account issues there.
