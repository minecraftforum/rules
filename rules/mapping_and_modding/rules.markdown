  A direct link is either a link where clicking on the link will download the file without going to another page or the page's purpose is to download the file. 
  An example of a direct download link is using dropbox or mediafire links, where the link is only used for the download. 
  These links may be used with monetary linking services.

* __Alternative Links__

  An alternative link is a link that is used for other things besides being a download page.
  An example of an alternative link is sites like Planet Minecraft links, where the link is used for other things as well.
  These links may not be used with monetary linking services.
