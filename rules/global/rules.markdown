# Global Guidelines

The guidelines and information below applies to the entire forum.

## Do

* __Be Nice And Polite__

    Every member deserves to be treated with respect. Positive and polite posts 
    create a friendly and welcoming environment that all members will feel comfortable in.

* __Search__

    Most questions have been asked before, searching for an answer to a question 
    before posting gets a question answered faster and keeps duplicate content 
    low.

* __Think Before Posting__

    Sensible, well thought-out and legible posts help other members understand
    what you are trying to explain.

* __Report Content__
    
    Reported content is sent to staff members for review, if a post needs to be 
    removed or modified then reporting will make that happen.

* __Post In Relevant Section(s)__

    Posting in the most relevant section will ensure topics are seen by members
    most interested in the subject. Topics posted in the wrong section will be
    moved by moderators.


## Do Not

* __Use Profanity__

    As a family friendly forum we censor all profanity, however the censor is
    not an excuse to still swear; all posts that contain any instance of 
    profanity will be removed. This includes profanity within acronyms.
    Self-censoring is also not allowed.

* __Bump Threads__
    
    Posting in a topic only to bring it back to the front page of the forum
    is not allowed, a topic should only be on the front page of a forum if there
    is active discussion taking place.

* __Spam__

    A spam post is a post that provides no value to the discussion. The most 
    common spam posts are posting "tl:dr;", "+1", "this", posting image macros,
    and nothing but memes or images. These sort of posts really rustle our jimmies.
    
* __Post Duplicate Threads__

    Posting duplicate topics around the forum is considered spam. There is no need
    to clutter the forum by posting multiple instances of the same thread.

* __Reply to Inappropriate Content__

    If inappropriate content is posted the report feature should be used,
    replying to inappropriate content escalates the issue and can result in all
    involved parties receiving infractions.

* __Trade or Sell Minecraft Accounts__
    
    We do not allow the sale of Minecraft Accounts, if you wish to acquire a
    Minecraft account please purchase via [Minecraft.net](http://minecraft.net).
	The sale of Minecraft Cape codes (eg: <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/MineCon#Cape_2">Minecon 2012 Cape</a>) 
    and any other game content is also disallowed.

* __Offer or Request Services/Products__
    
    With the exception of the
    [Minecraft Server Hosting](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/131-minecraft-server-hosting/)
    section and the
    [Shops/Requests](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/164-shopsrequests/)
    section, we do not allow members to trade or sell services/products.
    Forums are for discussions, they are not a market or trading place.

* __Post Giveaways__

    Member-run giveaways or contests that require performing a specific action
    for entry (eg: subscribe to my Youtube channel, follow me on Twitter) 
    are not allowed.

* __Advertise__

    Advertising a website in your signature is acceptable, however creating
    topics about your website is not allowed. If you want to advertise on
    minecraftforum.net please contact the 
    [Curse advertising department](http://www.curse.com/advertising/overview).

* __Misuse Money Linking Services__

    Sites that provide incentives for generating clickthroughs (such as adf.ly)
    are only allowed to be used for downloads of content that you created. We
    report any abuse to the site operators and will often result in the
    relevant accounts being shut down.

* __Hoax__

    Deliberately posting misleading or inaccurate information to confuse members
    is unacceptable. This includes sightings of Herobrine.

* __Access Accounts Without Permission__

    The only member permitted to access an account is the owner, unless permission
    is explicitly granted by that member.

* __Troll__

    Trolling of any kind is not tolerated.
    Accusing someone of trolling, which is known as "Troll Calling" is also disallowed,
    eg: "Stop trolling", "You're a troll!". If someone is trolling they should be 
    reported.
    
* __Flame or Provoke__

    Do not insult or flame other members of the forum. Similarly, do not post with the
    intention of provoking a reaction from fellow members. This includes encouraging flame
    wars. Instigation is not tolerated.
    
* __Use Referral/Affiliate Links__

    Linking to websites that provide you with cash or prizes in return for getting people 
    to view their page is not allowed. This includes affiliate programs.
    
* __Necro Post__

    Please do not reply to extremely old threads unless you are continuing
    substantial discussion of the topic. Contentless bumps which add very
    little to the discussion will be removed.
    
* __Post Provocative/Offensive Material__

    Provocative and/or offensive material of a sexual, violent or otherwise
    inappropriate nature is strictly not allowed. Please consider the types of
    content posted to a family friendly forum. Always ensure your content is both
    "Safe For Work" and suitable for children.
    
* __Misuse Alt Accounts__

    Using a secondary account to evade bans/suspensions, misrepresent a topic, self-rep
    or encourage misinformation is not allowed on the forums.
    
### Illegal Activity

* __Piracy__

    Distribution of any content not owned by the member is unacceptable, this 
    includes all forms of media piracy (music, film, video game etc). This rule
    also extends to linking to sites that primarily function as a facilitator of
    piracy.

* __Redistribution of Mojang Property__

    Minecraft and all associated assets are property of Mojang. Redistribution 
    of Mojang owned property (for example Minecraft.jar) is not allowed, all
    posts must remain inline with the 
    [Minecraft Terms Of Service](http://www.minecraft.net/terms). Linking to 
    Mojang hosted files is acceptable, eg: assets.minecraft.net.

* __Hate Speech__

    As a family friendly and all inclusive community we do not allow any form of
    discrimination, this includes -- but is not limited to -- age, race, gender,
    nationality, ethnicity, religion and sexuality.

* __Spread Malicious Content__

    Viruses and malware are forbidden, any intentional distribution of either
    will result in permanent exclusion from minecraftforum.net.

## Section Specific Rules

Each section (and individual forum) may have individual rules. Sectional rules 
do not contradict the global rules however they may require your posts to be in 
made in a specific way or contain information not required in other sections.

The sectional rules are also included in this document, after reading through
the remainder of the global rules you can scroll down to find the sectional 
rules.

## Moderator Action

The following information is about what to do when you find people breaking the rules and what happens if you break the rules outlined above.

### Reporting A Post

Rule breaking posts should be reported by any member that comes across them. There is a "report" button on every post, when a post is reported
the moderators of the site are alerted, reports automatically include the post content. Reports should contain an explanation of why a post is being reported.

Any content that needs moderator attention should be reported. There are no penalties for mis-reporting content.

### Mini Modding

Mini-modding is replying to a rule breaking post with information on the rule break. Some forms of mini-modding are allowed: 
If a member has broken a section specific rule (such as posting in the wrong section or not including required information) members 
are allowed to reply to the member explaining what rule has been broken and how to fix the issue. 
To be acceptable "Mini-modding" the post must meet the following requirements

* Explains which rule the post breaks
* Explains (where necessary) how the poster can rectify the issue
* Does not make statements such as: "reported", "I've told the mods", "This will be locked now" etc.

Then the member must report the post. "Mini-modding" without reporting the post is not allowed.

## Infractions

When a rule is broken an infraction will be issued. There are 2 types of infractions, formal and informal. 

### Informal

An informal infraction is used to remind a member that they have broken a minor rule for the first time. Informal infractions are used as a record
of when a member has been informed. There are no infraction points issued with informals, they do not count towards the posting suspension limits.

### Formal

A formal infraction is issued when a rule has been broken and we believe continued violation of this rule should result in a posting suspension.
A formal warning can have between 1 and 10 points associated with it, the average formal warning has 1 point.

### Points

Every 30 days infractions "expire" and the points are removed from a members total infraction points. If a member reaches a specific point total within
30 days posting suspensions are issued, the point total and suspension lengths are as follows:

* __1 Point__ No action
* __2 Points__ 3 day posting suspension
* __3 Points__ 7 day posting suspension
* __4 Points__ 7 day posting suspension
* __5 Points__ 7 day posting suspension
* __6 Points__ 14 day posting suspension
* __7 Points__ 14 day posting suspension
* __8 Points__ 14 day posting suspension
* __9 Points__ 14 day posting suspension
* __10 Points__ 30 day posting suspension


### Permanent Bans

Permanent bans are never automatically issued, they are reserved for members that we believe to be detrimental to the minecraftforum.net community.
They are issued to members that continually break the rules and do not provide any value to the community.

## Disclaimer

The administrators and moderators are responsible for the smooth and efficient running of the site. The staff reserves the right to take whatever action is deemed appropriate in any given situation, regardless of whether there is a specific rule covering that situation or not. If there is a misunderstanding or dispute, then please bring the issue up politely with that staff member in private. In all matters, the decision of the administration is final.

## Help And Support

Support is provided to minecraftforum.net members through the [Contact Forum Administration](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forum/64-contact-forum-administration/) section of the forum.
Private Messages are not an official method of requesting support and we do not guarantee that a private message sent to any staff member will be replied to.
