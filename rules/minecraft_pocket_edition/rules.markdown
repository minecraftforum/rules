# Minecraft: Pocket Edition

* __Do not partake in or create platform wars__

  Please do not make threads or comments regarding one platform being better than the other as they encourage flame wars within the community.

* __Do not post update threads__

  Threads requesting dates on when a certain update is to be released are not allowed. They are considered to be spamming the section as they have no discussion value. Such threads will be locked for redundancy.

## Discussion

* The discussion section is for general Pocket Edition discussion which does not fit into any other Pocket Edition forum.

### Support

* Threads must be concerning problems experienced with Minecraft: Pocket Edition
* Bumping support threads if no response is received within twelve hours is allowed

## Suggestions

* __Clearly title your threads__

  Be specific with your thread title. Always ensure that your topic titles are relevant to your suggestion. Good titles: "Underground cave biome" or "New mob: The T-Rex". Bad titles: "I have a suggestion!" or "Read my idea!"

* __No Duplicate Suggestions__

  Do not post duplicate suggestions, if an idea has been shared before continue the discussion in the pre-exisiting thread.

* __No Vague Suggestions__

  Suggestions that are vague or unclear will be removed, for proper discussion to happen suggestions must be well explained and if necessary, well demonstrated.

* __No Wishlists__

  Do not post more than one suggestion per thread. Very closely related suggestions are fine, but separate suggestions require separate threads. "Wishlists" will be closed or deleted.

* __Existing Mod(s)__

  If a mod exists that provides part (or all) of the suggestions request linking to the mod is encouraged, however do not use the existence of a mod to dismiss the suggestion. Suggestions are primarily for vanilla Minecraft features.

## Mapping and Modding

* No linking to sites that require a person to do surveys or require personal information, such as cell phone numbers

### Maps

* Map threads must include a download link to the map
* Monetary linking should only be used for download links

### Texture Packs

* __Label threads__

  Please label threads according to what platform it will work with whether it be iOS, Android or both.

* __Porting Texture Packs__

  If porting a texture pack from another platform then permissions from the original author must be gained and must be displayed within the topic.
